                        Gulab jamun is a popular South Asian dessert consisting of deep-fried balls made of khoya (milk solids) or milk powder, soaked in a sweet, fragrant syrup. It's known for its soft, spongy texture and sweet, aromatic flavor, often enjoyed during festivals and celebrations.

                        There are two possible reasons. Either the oil is not hot enough, or the dough is too dry. Make sure the oil is 350 F to 360 F. You may find it helpful to cover the dough as you're rolling it if rolling takes a long time; this will also help protect it from drying out.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Smooth out the cracks</strong> 
                        Any cracks that show up when rolling the dough into balls get worse later and could lead to the doughnuts cracking as they are fried. This is not desirable, so take all the time you need to make sure the balls of dough are very smooth.

                    <li>
                        <strong>Keep an eye on the heat</strong>
                        Do not cook the gulab jamun over very high heat (over 360 F), as the dumplings will burn on the outside and remain raw inside.

            <h2>Steps to make it</h2>

            <br>

            <ol class="steps-to-make">
                <li>
                    Add 6 cups water and 3 cups granulated sugar to a large saucepan. Bring to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally until the sugar dissolves.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn off the heat and stir in 1 tablespoon ground cardamom and 2 tablespoons rose water. Set the syrup aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a large bowl, combine 3 cups powdered milk, 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour, and 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add 1 cup heavy cream a little at a time while kneading to make a dough that is medium-soft but not sticky. You may not need to use all the cream. Use just enough to reach the desired consistency; the smoother it is, the better, and the less likely that the dough will become hard when it's fried.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Lightly oil the palms of your hands and once the dough is ready, divide it into walnut-sized balls, rolling it between your palms until nice and smooth.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, fill a wide pan with enough oil to deep fry the doughnuts. Heat the vegetable oil over over medium heat to between 350 F and 360 F.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Carefully add the gulab jamun and fry, in batches if necessary to not crowd the pan, turning often to brown all sides.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Once cooked, remove the doughnuts with a slotted spoon, allowing the oil to drain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Transfer immediately into the rose syrup.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Repeat this until all the dumplings are cooked and in the syrup. Allow the gulab jamun to soak in the syrup for at least 2 hours before serving. 
                </li>
            </ol>
